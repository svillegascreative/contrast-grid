# Contrast Grid

A little experiment to build a dynamic colour contrast grid!

**Note:** I'm Canadian, so I prefer spelling "colour" with a "u". However, to avoid bugs, all functional use of the word will follow the web standard "color" spelling. I will insist on adding the "u" in all rendered/UI text, though, because üçÅ.

## Stack

- [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/) & SvelteKit
- [ColorJS](https://colorjs.io/) for colour contrast calculation
- Some web components from [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style)

## Getting started

- `npm run dev` gets the dev server running üòâ

## Roadmap

Just some brief notes to keep track of where I'm at and what I'm planning to do next.

1. Full a11y check
1. Keep swatch size consistent to avoid grid shifting
1. Make permalink button copy URL to clipboard
1. Enable removing colours. What is a good UI for this?

### Issues

- [CURRENT] conditions for hiding cells is wrong

### Ideas

- Calculate "percent passing"
- Create collection of palettes
- Highlight tanble headers (colour values) when a swatch is hovered/focused
- hide swatches selectively
