# Contrast Grid

A little experiment to build a colour contrast grid, learning SvelteKit and ColorJS.

## Getting started

- `npm run dev` gets the dev server running 😉

## Roadmap

Just some brief notes to keep track of where I'm at and what I'm planning to do next.

1. [CURRENT] Make UI pretty
1. Make permalink button copy URL to clipboard
1. Enable add/remove colours to expand palette and grid

### Ideas

- Calculate "percent passing"
- Create collection of palettes
